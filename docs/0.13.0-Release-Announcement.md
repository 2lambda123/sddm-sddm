The SDDM team is proud to announce the release 0.13.0 of SDDM,
the Simple Desktop Display Manager.

SDDM is made possible thanks to the collaborative work of the [Hawaii](http://hawaiios.org),
[KDE](https://www.kde.org) and [LXDE](http://lxqt.org) projects, as well as the help and contributions from dozens
of other developers.

Change log:

 * Greeter inherits path environment variables from parent so that
   themes installed in non-standard paths will work.
 * Add ENABLE_PAM option to toggle PAM support at build time.
 * Allow overriding textColor in ComboBox.
 * Don't cast QByteArray to (char *).
 * Disable greeters from loading KDE's debug hander
   (fix CVE-2015-0856).
 * Fix multi-screen support for some setups.
 * Added Serbian translation.
 * Added Traditional Chinese translation.
 * Improved German translation.
 * Remove failsafe session entry.
 * Close the pipe fd passed to X server.
