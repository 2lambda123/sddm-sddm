## Introduction

SDDM is a modern display manager for X11 and Wayland aiming to be fast, simple and beautiful.
It uses modern technologies like QtQuick, which in turn gives the designer the ability to
create smooth, animated user interfaces.

SDDM is extremely themeable. We put no restrictions on the user interface design,
it is completely up to the designer. We simply provide a few callbacks to the user interface
which can be used for authentication, suspend etc.

To further ease theme creation we provide some premade components like a textbox,
a combox etc.

There are a few sample themes distributed with SDDM.
They can be used as a starting point for new themes.
