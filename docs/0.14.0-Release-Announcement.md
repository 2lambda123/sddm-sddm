The SDDM team is proud to announce the release 0.14.0 of SDDM,
the Simple Desktop Display Manager.

SDDM is made possible thanks to the collaborative work of the [Hawaii](http://hawaiios.org),
[KDE](https://www.kde.org) and [LXQt](http://lxqt.org) projects, as well as the help and contributions from dozens of other developers.

With this release, SDDM requires at least Qt 5.6.0 which includes QScreen improvements
and HighDPI support.

The greeter now enables the HighDPI scaling Qt application attribute and there are a
number of improvements for theming and appearance:

 * Qt platform theme selected with the "platformTheme" from theme.conf
   is now set correctly
 * Themes can now select which QtQuick Controls 2.0 style to use with
   the new "style" setting from theme.conf
 * The ComboBox component now exposes the arrow background color as
   an "arrowColor" property
 * More theme-neutral default user and root avatars

The "circles" theme was removed, please remember to change if you had it set.

The "maui" theme is no longer a standalone theme, it is rather embedded into
the greeter. The default value for the "Current" setting in the "Theme"
section of sddm.conf is now empty, please remember to empty it if you had
it set to "maui".

With an embedded theme, SDDM is now much more robust and no longer show a
white an completely unusable greeter if something bad happens:

 * If the selected theme no longer exist, SDDM will silently fallback
   to the embedded theme
 * If the selected theme has QML errors, SDDM will fallback to the embedded
   theme and display the errors with a red message

The greeter now refreshes the sessions list if there are changes at the
file system level and allows you to hide avatars with the "EnableAvatars"
setting (useful for slow file systems).

User session log path can be changed with the new "SessionLogFile" setting
of the "X11" and "Wayland" sections of sddm.conf.

Xauthority path can be changed with the "UserAuthFile" setting of the
"X11" section of sddm.conf

There are also improvements for Wayland user sessions: the vt is changed
only when the authentication succeeds.

PAM improvements include closing the PAM session when the user session quits,
and deleting PAM credentials after that.

Like previous releases we have a bunch of updates to translations.

The list of changes is also available in our ChangeLog file:
